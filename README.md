## 💡 What is Growth Tracker?

We all have 24 hours in a day — but where do they actually go?

**Growth Tracker** helps you answer that question by logging time across meaningful life categories like sleep, work, fitness, family, and more. Complete your day by logging all 24 hours, stay consistent, and watch your streak grow!
